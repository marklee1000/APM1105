    "This time, the render times for both methods are always zero until n gets quite large (n>100). Also, their render times will sometimes be both zero even at very large n numbers. Most of the time, both render times are zero but there are unoccasional instances where recursion is VERY SLIGHTLY SLOWER than iteration. Thus for this problem, they have more or less the same processing time but iteration will sometimes be FASTER than recursion. This is maybe for the same reason as 1 where iteration requires less processing time."
